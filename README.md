# EngEconWidget
A widget calculator I made to assist myself and some of my classmates to ease the process of completing homework as well as studying for an Engineering Economics course.

Engineering Economics has a lot of tedious and repetative formulas that are hard to caclulate manually. There was no website that had all the formulas for the course integrated in one place, so i thought of making an application that would have all these formulas integrated and can be used by a click of button.
